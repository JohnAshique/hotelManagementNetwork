In this project, a hotel network system has been implemented. There are 3 floors, where each floor is a different department. On the first level, there are Reception, store and Logistics. On the second floor there are Finance, HR and Sales/Marketing. Laslty, the third floor has IT and Admin.

There should be routers on each department/ floor.
All routers should be connected with serial DCE cable. Each floor should have switch and printer. Finally each department is expected to be in different VLAN.

The network between routers should be 10.10.10.0/30, 10.10.10.4/30, 10.10.10.8/30.
